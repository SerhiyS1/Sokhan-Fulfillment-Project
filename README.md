# Sokhan Fulfillment Project
Hi! Welcome to my Web Fulfillment Data Analysis! This is the repo for this Shiny App:

People buy a LOT of Harvard apparel.  When an order is placed on theharvardshop.com,
it is up to the Web Fullfillment team to fulfill online orders.  Why is this relevant?  Well, 
for the past year, I have been the Web Fulfillment Manager of The Harvard Shop.  With a team of 
15-20 employees, I was responsible for the packaging, shipping, and customer service of over 
12,000 orders.  These 12,000 orders were shipped to countries all around the world.

The analysis presented in this project serves two main purposes.  The first is to allow those
that are interested to explore the amount of orders and average order value per month for 
different countries.  The second is to provide my successor with an app that can give him
insights into which periods of the year are busier and which periods have higher average
basket values.  As the manager, it is crucial to schedule employees well enough to maintain
budget while also sticking to our policy of shipping orders out within one business day.
In addition, it is important to order enough shipping supplies for the month. The 
quantities and types of supplies needed depend on the amount of orders and the size of the
average order.

The Harvard Shop uses the e-commerce platform Shopify. Shopify is an avid supporter of using data in business frequently to
allow retailers to identify trends and make data-driven decisions. As such, the platform does a fantastic job of providing 
clean data that can be exported easily. I purposely exported and used data that does not reveal any information about unique
orders or customers. The dataset is available in this Github repository.

This Shiny App allows users to identify many trends.  In the app, there is a tab that discusses interesting findings on topics 
such as where most of our orders come from, which types of countries yield more frequent international orders, when the
average order values peak and why, the effect of admissions decisions on sales, and more.  Enjoy looking around, and if you
have any questions, feel free to email me at serhiysokhan@college.harvard.edu.
